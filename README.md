From the navigation bar at top:

click Scraper, it'll run the scraper functions currently written in functions_[...].py
    right now, clicking scraper, runs the algorithm locally, and saves .csv, .json files in current date subdirectory &           allTime subdirectory

click Filter, it'll run the filter functions currently writtern in functions_twitter_filter.py or functions_web_filter.py
