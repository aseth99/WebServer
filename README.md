# WebServer
learning how to make a web server &amp; integrating python code with it

app.py is the main file we have to run

do chmod a+x ClickHere.sh to change permissions so we can run file 
change ClickHere default application to terminal

ClickHere: changes directory into WebServer and runs app.py
ClickHere2: opens Google Chrome to localhost so we can view project

From the navigation bar, if you click Scraper, it'll run the scraper currently written in functions.py
  need to change this to a more elegant method
  right now, clicking scraper, runs the algorithm locally, and saves .txt, .json files
